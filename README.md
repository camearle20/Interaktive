# Interaktive

Interaktive is a piece of software that attempts to emulate an airline's software system for managing passengers.

It is by no means suitable for use in a production environment; it is instead just an interesting program to mess with.
This is mainly to expand my Java knowledge, and perhaps you can take something away from the command handling system that
this software uses.  If I get it stable enough I will make it as a seperate library and distribute it.

Fork if you want, tell me if you make something cool.
